A highly customizable Gauge component for **Angular >= 4.3.x || >=5.0.0**  apps and dashboards. It provides many configurationable options to customize according to your needs. Checkout the live demo [here](https://ashish-chopra.github.io/ngx-gauge).

# Getting Started

#### step 1: Install npm module

```bash
npm install --save ngx-gauge
```
This will install the current stable version of `ngx-gauge` in your `node_modules` directory and save the entry in `package.json`.

#### Step 2: Import the _NgxGaugeModule_

```ts
import { NgxGaugeModule } from 'ngx-gauge';

@NgModule({
    ...
    imports: [NgxGaugeModule],
    ...
})
export class AppModule { }

```
Be sure to import `NgxGaugeModule` after Angular's `BrowserModule`, as the import order matters for _NgModules_.

#### Step 3: Use gauge component in HTML
`NgxGaugeModule` provides a `<ngx-gauge>` component which can be used in any angular template to render a gauge.
It's configuration properties can be bind to a typescript variable as shown below:

```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-component',
    templateUrl: 'app.html'
})
export class AppComponent {

    gaugeType = "semi";
    gaugeValue = 28.3;
    gaugeLabel = "Speed";
    gaugeAppendText = "km/hr";
}
```

```html
<ngx-gauge [type]="gaugeType"
           [value]="gaugeValue"
           [label]="gaugeLabel"  
           [append]="gaugeAppendText">
</ngx-gauge>
```

Checkout the extensive list of configuration properites given below and try them to acheive your desired customization. In case you face any problem, then raise an issue [here](https://github.com/ashish-chopra/ngx-gauge/issues).

# Configuration Properties

There are plenty of configurable properties available to tune the gauge as per your needs.

| Name      | Description  | Required  | Default value  | Possible values |
| ---       | ---          | ---       | ---               | ---            |
| `size`    | Specifies the size of the canvas in which Gauge will be drawn. It is used as `width` and `height` both. | No       | `200` | Positive Integer           |
| `type`      | Specifies the gauge's type.                     | No        | `"full"`     |  `"full"`, `"semi"`, `"arch"`  |
| `min`  | Specifies the minimum numeric value for gauge's scale.  | No     | `0`  | Any numeric value  |
| `max` | Specified the maximum numeric value for gauge's scale. | No       | `100`  | Any numeric value  |
| `value`          | Specifies the current value of the Gauge in the range specified by `min` and `max`. It is a required attribute.       | Yes       | `undefined`  | Any numeric value |
| `cap`       | The style of line ending at the gauge's end.    | No        | `"butt"`    | `"round"`, `"butt"`           |
| `thick`        | Specified the thickness of the gauge's bar.            | No        | `6`        | Any Positive Integer |
| `label`       | Specifies the text to display below the Gauge's reading.  | No  | `undefined`                | Any String           |
| `foregroundColor`         | Specifies the foreground color of the Gauge's scale.                    | No       | `rgba(0, 150, 136, 1)`             |   Any color value string       |
| `backgroundColor`    | Specifies the background color of the Gauge's scale.| No        |    `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)`           |    Any color value string        |
| `append`   | Specifies a `string` appended to the Gauge's reading. For example `"%"` most commonly used. | No        | `undefined`        | Any string           |
| `prepend`      | Specifies a `string` prepended to the Gauge's reading. For example `"$"` in case of financial data displayed in Gauge.                                        | No        | `undefined`            | Any String           |
| `duration`    | Specifies the duration (in milliseconds) of the Gauge's animation | No       | `1500` | Positive Integer           |
| `thresholds` | Specifies an object of threshold values at which the gauge's color changes. Checkout an example [here](#configure-threshold-color-ranges).  | No |  `none` | {}
| `animate` | Enables/disables animation  | No |  `true` | Boolean

## Configure Threshold Color Ranges

You can customize the colors of the gauge based on the current value being shown. In order to show different colors when gauge crosses certain value, use property `thresholds`. It takes an object with the threshold value  as `key` and an object with `color` property as `value`. For example:

```ts
@Component({ ... })
export class AppComponent {
    ...

    thresholdConfig = {
        '0': {color: 'green'},
        '40': {color: 'orange'},
        '75.5': {color: 'red'}
    };

    ...
}
```

```html
<ngx-gauge ...  [thresholds]="thresholdConfig"></ngx-gauge>
```
The keys in the threshold object signifies the minimum value at which the color will be applied. For instance, if the gauge's current value is `53.2`, then orange color will be applied because after point `40` every value will be displayed as `orange`, until next threshold is encountered. In this example `75.5` is the next threshold.

## Custom Directives for display text
Sometimes setting a property value on `<ngx-gauge>` does not solve your purpose. You may want to add custom HTML for displaying `value`,`append`, `prepend` and `label` texts. In order to provide custom templates for these properties display following directives can be used.

```html
<ngx-gauge [value]="currentValue">
    <ngx-gauge-append>
        <!-- custom append text or HTML goes here -->
    </ngx-gauge-append>
    <ngx-gauge-label>
        <!-- custom label text or HTML goes here -->
    </ngx-gauge-label>
    <ngx-gauge-prepend>
        <!-- custom prepend text or HTML goes here -->
    </ngx-gauge-prepend>
    <ngx-gauge-value>
        {{ currentValue * Math.PI | number }}
    </ngx-gauge-value>
</ngx-gauge>
```
Note that `value` attribute is still required on `<ngx-gauge>` even when you are providing custom template using `<ngx-gauge-value>`. Because `value` attribute is responsible for calculating the gauge's drawing on a scale.

<!-- # Playground

The examples section is redesigned as a playground where you can play with Gauge by tuning its different parameters.
And, you can see the result live on-screen. It is good start to get familiar with Gauge.
